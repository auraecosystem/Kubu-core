# KUBU Core

KUBU is a Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency focused on human-readable nicknames.
Instead of sending only to long wallet addresses, users can send payments to
active nicknames and optionally include memo tags for exchange/service routing.

## Project Overview
Kubu A decentralized network where people, businesses,
services, and applications can own nicknames
and use them as payment and identity endpoints.

KUBU Core is the reference node and wallet implementation for the KUBU network.
It includes:

- full node (`kubud`)
- CLI (`kubu-cli`)
- transaction tool (`kubu-tx`)
- GUI wallet (`kubu-qt`)
- nickname operations at protocol and wallet level

## Core Characteristics

- Name: `KUBU`
- Ticker: `KUBU`
- Algorithm: `Scrypt` PoW + `AuxPoW` (merge mining)
- Block time: `54 seconds`
- AuxPoW activation height (mainnet): `39,000`
- Address prefix (mainnet): starts with `P`
- Reward schedule:
  - Blocks 0-1,167,999: `48 KUBU`
  - Blocks 1,168,000-2,335,999: `24 KUBU`
  - Blocks 2,336,000-3,503,999: `12 KUBU`
  - Blocks 3,504,000-4,671,999: `6 KUBU`
  - Blocks 4,672,000+: `2 KUBU` tail reward

## Nickname System

KUBU nicknames are on-chain identities with a lifecycle and anti-squatting
bond model.

- Register nickname
- Update payout address
- Transfer ownership
- Renew validity period
- Release nickname
- Claim bond
- Send to nickname (`sendtonickname`)
- Optional memo tags (`KMEM1`) for exchange/service flows

Nickname economics combine:

- registration fee (network fee requirement)
- locked bond amount (claimable later according to status rules)

## Network Ports

Default ports configured in KUBU Core:

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   45874 |   46874 |   47874 |
| RPC      |   45873 |   46873 |   47873 |

Do not expose RPC ports to the public internet.
